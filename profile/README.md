# The FEDEM Open Source Project

The FEDEM simulation software including its graphical user interface
has been under development since the early nineties as a proprietary code.
Due to limited and reduced commercial use, its owner SAP SE has decided
to sunset FEDEM as a component in its product portfolio.

The source code is now therefore provided to the public under a open source
license, as a service to previous users and to ensure that it can still be
maintained by the community.

## Repository organisation

The FEDEM source code is organized into several repositories, using the
`git submodule` concept to maintain relations between them.
The main repositories are as follows:

* [fedem-gui](https://github.com/openfedem/fedem-gui) - The FEDEM user interface (C++ code)
* [fedem_mdb](https://github.com/openfedem/fedem-mdb) - The FEDEM model database (C++ code)
* [fedem_solvers](https://github.com/openfedem/fedem-solvers) - The solver modules and Python API (Fortran and python code)

For more information, see the project home page [openfedem.org](https://openfedem.org).
